# Mindmap

A project to make a mind map of topics/fields/ideas in artificial intelligence/machine learning, cognitive sciences, computational complexity, â€¦ and other related areas.

When does a link become strong enough that it turns into its own node???

Like [this](http://wiki.polyfra.me/#)? Ah, so we need to make some sort of wiki thing first? The data.

## To-dos
### Needs
* Ability to query edges for information on the connection.
* Clear layout.
* Heirarchical??


### Wants
* Choose (sub) fields to show? Somehow nested?
* 

## Contributions


### Examples

##### Nodes
Edit/see [this]() file.

There are expected to have a brief description of the subject/topic/idea/field with links to interesting resources.

Algorithmic game theory : Blah
Machine learning theory : ..


##### Edges 
Edit/see [this]() file.

There are expected to have a brief description of the connection between the two subjects/topics/ideas/fields, also with links to interesting resources.

# Road map

A road map showing the problems to be solved before we get to AGI.
