A project to make a mind map of topics/fields/ideas in artificial intelligence/machine learning, cognitive sciences, computational complexity, â€¦ and other related areas.

When does a link become strong enough that it turns into its own node???

**To-dos**
### Needs
* Ability to query edges for information on the connection.
* Clear layout.
* Heirarchical??


### Wants
* Choose (sub) fields to show? Somehow nested?
* 

**Contributions**


### Examples

# Nodes
Edit/see [this]() file.

There are expected to have a brief description of the subject/topic/idea/field with links to interesting resources.

Algorithmic game theory : Blah
Machine learning theory : ..


# Edges 
Edit/see [this]() file.

There are expected to have a brief description of the connection between the two subjects/topics/ideas/fields, also with links to interesting resources.
